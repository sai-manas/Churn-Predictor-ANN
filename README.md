# Churn-Predictor-ANN
Visit the web application: [Churn Predictor App](https://churn-predictor-ann-nu6tgtwpyh7njgtjzbjt6z.streamlit.app/)

## Description
Churn Predictor - Web Application: Predict customer churn using an ANN model deployed in a user-friendly Streamlit app. The application leverages standard preprocessing techniques including label encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling. Users can input customer details to predict churn probability with a dynamic and interactive interface. The model achieves an accuracy of 85%.

## Features
- Predict customer churn using an ANN model.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Standard preprocessing techniques: label encoding, one-hot encoding, and scaling.
- Interactive input for customer details.
